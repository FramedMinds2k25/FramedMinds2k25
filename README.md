# FramedMinds 2k25

Welcome to **FramedMinds 2k25** â€“ a group of three passionate individuals exploring the frontiers of Artificial Intelligence. Our focus lies in building intelligent systems using cutting-edge technologies such as AI agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbots, and conducting original research in the broader domain of AI.

## ðŸš€ What We Do

- ðŸ¤– **AI Agents**: We develop autonomous and semi-autonomous agents capable of decision-making, problem-solving, and task execution in dynamic environments.
- ðŸ’¬ **RAG-based Chatbots**: Leveraging the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation to create more informative and context-aware chatbot solutions.
- ðŸ“š **AI Research**: We actively contribute to AI research through experimentation, model development, and publishing findings in relevant areas like natural language processing, agent architectures, and AI safety.

## ðŸ”¬ Areas of Interest

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Agentic AI Systems
- Prompt Engineering
- AI for Automation
- Knowledge Retrieval and Augmentation
- Human-AI Interaction
